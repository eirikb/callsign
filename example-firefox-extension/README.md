Example Firefox extension

For now this is a _very_ manual demo.  
You must copy content from "output" and paste into "input" of another extension.  
This can be used to demo the key exchange and messaging in any other app,  
such as Teams of Discord.

Verification of domain is done inside the extension, this could be faked if not, because I don't know any way to securely verify that `fetch` is the native one.
